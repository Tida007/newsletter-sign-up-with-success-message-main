## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.



**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Your users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.


There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
